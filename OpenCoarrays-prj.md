author_description: Sourcery Institute is a California public-benefit nonprofit corporation engaged in research, education, and consulting in computational science, engineering, and mathematics (CSEM).  We are a network of independent CSEM professionals who research and develop advanced software engineering methods, tools, and libraries for CSEM.  We teach related short courses and university courses.   We also lead and contribute to open-source software and open language standards used in CSEM fields.

Brief description
-----------------

@warning
The OpenCoarrays API documentation is currently underconstruction. As
such, information may be missing orincomplete on this website. Please
check back frequently for updated content.

OpenCoarrays is an open-source software project that produces an
application binary interface (ABI) supporting coarray Fortran (CAF)
compilers, an application programming interface (API) that supports
users of non-CAF compilers, and an associated compiler wrapper and
program launcher.

OpenCoarrays supports the coarray parallel programming feature set
specified in the Fortran 2008 standard.  We also support several
features proposed for Fortran 2015 in the draft Technical
Specification [TS18508] Additional Parallel Features in Fortran.

### ToDo

 - [X] Add brief description text
 - [ ] Macros should be passed on command line to FORD by build system
 - [ ] MPI include should be passed on the command line (ideally,
       although presently not supported) or specified by configuring this
       file with CMake...
 - [ ] Deal with `include compiler_capabilities.txt`
 - [ ] Add documentation to [[libcaf.h]]
 - [ ] Add documentation to [[libcaf-gfortran-descriptor.h]]
 - [ ] Add documentation to [[mpi_caf.c]]
 - [ ] Add documentation to [[caf_auxiliary.c]]
 - [ ] Add documentation to [[opencoarrays(module)]]
 - [ ] Add documentation to [[single.c]] (or remove it...)
 - [ ] Add documentation for unit tests
 - [ ] Add documentation for integration tests

Compilers
---------

The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Fortran front-end (GFortran) v. 5.1 and later employ OpenCoarrays to support parallel execution.
